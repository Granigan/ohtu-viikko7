## Summary of the Lean Primer

**Lean thinking** ("*Lean*") originates from the car company Toyota, and is largely credited for the great business success and longevity of the company. Lean is a system and perhaps a philosophy that Toyota's - and today many other companies - operations and functionality is built on.

The Lean structure consists of two pillars (Continuous Improvement and Respect for People) that build on the foundation and support the goal. Inside there structure, there's room for Product Development, and the 14 principles of Lean. 

Most fundamentally, Lean is an ideology that the entire enterprise must adhere to truly reap the rewards. While it includes a multitude of tools and methodologies that even alone are worthwhile, ultimately Lean collects them into a whole that affects the functionality on all levels. Adopting Lean as a whole is likely a process that requires years, if not decades to fully grow into, but promises a dramatically successful future for the company.
